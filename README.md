After setting up the app, you'll be able to create widgets with custom content that could be embedded in external sites. The widgets will include custom content

index.html is a plain bootstrap template that I used to embed widgets.

## Setup

```
bundle install
bundle exec rails db:create
bundle exec rails db:migrate
```
